# VueJS SPA for art collections

### What?
A test task: create an app for artworks using VueJS. I decided to use Firebase for fast API and Webpack for bundling.

### Why?
To find out how VueJS works, how Webpack bundles, how Firebase works.

### Where?
I managed to deploy it to Heroku with [this awesome guide](http://ditrospecta.com/javascript/react/es6/webpack/heroku/2015/08/08/deploying-react-webpack-heroku.html) so the results are all [here](https://artfinder-spa.herokuapp.com/).

## Install
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Run
```bash
$ npm start
or
$ bin/run
```
This will launch webpack and it will open a webpack-dev-server instance at http://localhost:3000 for you.
