# VueJS SPA for art collections

### What?
A test task.

### Why?
To find out how VueJS works, how Webpack bundles, how Firebase works.

### Where?
I'm going to deploy it to Heroku!

---

## Install
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Run
```bash
$ npm start
```
This will launch webpack and it will start a webpack-dev-server instance at http://localhost:3000 for you.
